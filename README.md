# Work in progress

Developing a way to retrieve good resources.
Instrcutions:
- Run the backend with the following command from root folder: `fastapi dev backend/api.py`.
- Run the frontend in dev mode with the following command from root folder: `rio run frontend/app.py`.

## Notes
I had some problems installing Sentence Transformers [1] with `pip`, hence I added a bash script with instructions that worked for me.
